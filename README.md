# Heavily WIP lot of checking so it takes a while
# Awesome-CustomRoms
This is a list of **active** custom roms based of other lists. This is not a list of gsis for that you should check a [list](https://github.com/TrebleDroid/treble_experimentations/wiki/Generic-System-Image-%28GSI%29-list) from TrebleDroid.
## What is considered active
An active custom rom needs to be either Android 15/16 or needs to have activity(such as blog posts or github activity with in this month). If you want to check inactive custom roms or what I have gone trough check [this](Inactive.md) list.
## What needs to be done
I first need to go trough all of those sources add them to the list. Next I need to sort the alphabeticly. After that I can possibly add a description for each rom or add more such as recoveries.
## Sources
