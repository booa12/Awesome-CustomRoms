# Awesome-CustomRoms
This is a list of **active** custom roms based of other lists. This is not a list of gsis for that you should check a [list](https://github.com/TrebleDroid/treble_experimentations/wiki/Generic-System-Image-%28GSI%29-list) from TrebleDroid.
## What is considered active
An active custom rom needs to be either Android 15/16 or needs to have activity(such as blog posts or github activity).
